# DressHub
DressHub is a clothing rental platform where users can rent clothing from other users. 

Clothing items such suits and dresses are typically rarely worn, only used for special occasions or one-time events such as weddings or a celebration. For many, purchasing a new dress or suit for every event isn’t a feasible task. Whether due to cost or storage space, many people don’t want to purchase something to only be worn once. Dress Hub solves that issue by allowing short-term rentals on clothing pieces, both helping users save money and also reducing the amount of clothing waste created.

With Dress Hub, users can rent out their clothes to others, giving their old garments new life. By facilitating the renting process using Dress Hub, it provides an accessible and responsive online rental platform for ease of use for users both renting and renting out clothing.
